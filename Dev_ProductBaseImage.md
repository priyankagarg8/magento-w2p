Magento has something called _base image_ for products. Usually the base image shows within a zoom control. Base images act differently on products with w2p personalization.

# Default ZetaPrints theme #
A base image is displayed within a zoom control when the product page is loaded for the first time. The base image and the zoom control are replaced by an updated preview image when such is generated by ZP.

# 2-step ZetaPrints theme #
A base image is displayed withing a zoom control only on first step and only until the preview is updated.
