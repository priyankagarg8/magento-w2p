Magento is an open source e-commerce platform. It can be used as an online shop for selling personalized products and designs using [ZetaPrints](http://www.zetaprints.com) [web-to-print and image generation API](http://www.zetaprints.com/help/category/api/).
The extension syncs the data between the two apps in a way that all processes are hosted within Magento interface, even if they are executed by ZetaPrints. Read full [web-to-print software overview](http://www.zetaprints.com/magento-web-to-print) for more details.

This extension can be installed manually or as a [package from Magento website](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/ZetaPrints/extension/1586/web_to_print_store_incl_theme). Either way you need to follow some steps and configure it properly. See links on the right for more info and download locations.
